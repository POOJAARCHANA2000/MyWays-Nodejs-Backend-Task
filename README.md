# MyWays-Nodejs-Backend-Task
I first created User Model for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.  Some npm install libraries :  Express body-parser Mongoose I used Postman to check all the APIs working perfectly. Operations that have checked on Postman.  Create(Create name,email,reviews) Login/Logout(For User) Delete(Delete an user) Modify or Update(Edit all reviews) I've used Schema Middleware for User Authentication using JsonWebToken Usually JsonWebToken has 2 operations for creating and verifying tokens.  jwt.sign({user.data},"String") jwt.verify(token,"String")
